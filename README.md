# Big-Data-Management-in-SAP-HANA
Enterprise applications have become quite complex and demanding in the past years and many applications require processing of analytical transactions or running reports, while many users consume and update the data. The growth in capacity of main memory enabled a completely new database paradigm called in-memory columnar database. SAP High Performance Analytics Appliance (HANA) was made with the goal of combining analytical and transactional data into the same database. This is made possible with three main factors namely, multicore parallel processing, availability of faster and cheaper main memory and the use of columnar architecture. The columnar database uses effective compression techniques, maximum parallelization of database kernels and specialized data structures to support the complete data lifecycle which involves modeling, provisioning and consumption. In this paper, we delve into the scenario for the emergence of SAP HANA, its architecture and advantages. We will also provide an in-depth analysis of in-memory columnar database technology.
